# TeamBurn Weather App

## Project

This is a groupproject for an assignment in html, css and javascript. We have created a weatherwebsite that allows you to compare the weather between the three biggest cities in Rwanda and the three biggest cities in Sweden.
The website also allows you to check the weather in any city in the world by searching for it. When you search you will get the current weather aswell as the forecast for the upcoming two days.
Upon entering the website, if you allow it to track your coordinates it will give the starting values based on the closest city to you currently.
Javascript was used in order to get data that was taken from the OpenWeatherMap Current Weather aswell as OpenWeatherMap 5 day / 3 hour forecast API's. We also used the built in GetCurrentPosition-method in javascript with the reverse Geocoding API from Openweather to get the users closest city.
The project is styled using CSS and fully responsive by using mediaqueries and flexbox.
HTML was used to set the framework for the website and create the starting fields.
